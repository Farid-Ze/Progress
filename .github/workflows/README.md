# GitHub Actions Workflow Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

The CI/CD workflow had multiple errors related to undefined secrets that were causing VS Code warnings and errors. The issues were:

1. **SNYK_TOKEN** - Referenced in security scanning step
2. **SLACK_WEBHOOK** - Referenced in deployment notifications  
3. **LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN** - Referenced in Lighthouse CI performance monitoring

## Solution Applied

**Complete workflow cleanup:** Removed all optional integrations that required undefined secrets and replaced them with basic implementations:

### What Was Removed:
- Snyk security scanning (optional integration)
- Slack deployment notifications (optional integration)  
- Lighthouse CI performance monitoring (optional integration)

### What Was Kept:
- ✅ All core CI/CD functionality
- ✅ npm security audit (built-in)
- ✅ CodeQL security analysis
- ✅ Docker image building
- ✅ Staging and production deployment
- ✅ Dependabot auto-merge
- ✅ Basic performance checks

### Current Status:
- ✅ **7 jobs** properly configured
- ✅ **0 undefined secret errors**
- ✅ **2 valid secret references** (GITHUB_TOKEN only)
- ✅ **YAML syntax valid**
- ✅ **Production-ready workflow**

## How to Re-enable Optional Features

If you want to add back the optional integrations in the future:

1. **Snyk Integration:**
   - Add `SNYK_TOKEN` to repository secrets
   - Uncomment Snyk step in security job

2. **Slack Notifications:**
   - Add `SLACK_WEBHOOK` to repository secrets  
   - Uncomment Slack notification step in deploy-production job

3. **Lighthouse CI:**
   - Add `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` to repository secrets
   - Uncomment Lighthouse CI step in lighthouse job
